Kubectl: CLI to configure Kubernetes and manage apps; Using "cube control" official pronunciation

The kubelet is an agent that runs on each node in a Kubernetes cluster. It ensures containers are running in a pod and communicates with the Kubernetes control plane.

Kubelet itself doesn't have a command-line interface like kubectl, but it can be configured with specific flags and commands via its configuration file or when starting the kubelet process. Common commands/flags include --config (to specify a config file), --kubeconfig (for Kubernetes API server authentication), --bootstrap-kubeconfig (for initial bootstrapping), and --container-runtime (to specify the container runtime).
